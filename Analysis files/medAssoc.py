    filepath is a string containing a valid filepath to a .txt data file.
    Returns a list of lists with each sublist containing an integer

    Format from Anna Noel Samaha's lab


    A variable : Total number of infusions during the 6-H session
    E variable : Total number of inactive-lever presses during the 6-H session
    D and Q variables (The same - because FR1) : Number of infusions inside each 6-minutes active phases
    F variable : Number of inactive lever presses inside each 6-minutes active phase
    K variable : Difference between infusion times (If you need more details about the interval between infusions, i have studied extensively this parameter inside each  6-minutes active phases) 
    S variable (the more important) : The time where infusions have been consumed during the session.
